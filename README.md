# NyoUI
A GUI Framework for Computercraft

check out my [wiki](https://github.com/NoryiE/NyoUI/wiki/) for information

Todo:<br>
-improve correct focus on frames (sometimes still wrong)<br>
-better checkbox (add width, length and text)<br>
-fix shit link bug<br>
-fix textfield if you remove everything it does not go back to wIndex 1 (and maybe add mouse selection)<br>
-add scrollbars to frames, lists and textfields<br>
-change scrollbar so it changes it's size based of maxIndex AND add smaller lines<br>
-change dropdown to create a frame with a list in it with much more changability instead of the current shit<br>
-add the possiblity to disable objects (they shouldn't react to incomming events)
-have to rework the entire drawing system
