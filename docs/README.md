# Welcome to The Basalt Wiki!
*Note: The Basalt Wiki is a work in progress, now also just migrated away from github wiki. Please treat Wiki errors the same as bugs and report them accordingly.*

Here you can find information about how to use Basalt as well as examples of functional Basalt code. The aim of Basalt is to improve user interaction through visual display.

On the right side of this page you can find a Wiki Navigation, where you can find a more detailed list of Basalt's features
