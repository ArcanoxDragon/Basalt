The image object is for adding more advanced backgrounds.
It also provides a :shrink() function, where you can shrink the images to smaller ones. This functionallity is fully provided by the blittle library created by Bomb Bloke. I did not ask for permission to add it into the framework. If the creator wants me to remove the blittle part, just text me on discord!

The image object is still not done. in the future i will provide more image formats.

[Object](objects/Object.md) methods also apply for images.
