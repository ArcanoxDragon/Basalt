## Questions & Bugs

Obviously I've implemented some easter eggs, _some people_ call them "bugs". If you happen to discover one of these just make a new <a href="https://github.com/NoryiE/Basalt/issues">issue</a>. 

Additionally, if you have questions about Basalt or how to make use of it, feel free to create a new discussion on <a href="https://github.com/NoryiE/Basalt/discussions">Basalt's Discussion Board</a>.
